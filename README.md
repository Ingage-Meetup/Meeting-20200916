# Meeting-20200916

  ## This month's exercise
  
     In this month's exercise, we will take an implementation of the Compare Poker Hands kata from August and refactor it. The implementation is a working version that        has been defactored (is that a thing?) so that it violates clean coding practices. 
  
     Your task is to refactor the code and make it better while ensuring all the tests pass.
  
 ## Instructions
 
     The defactored code is contained in a branch called kens-defactored-code.
 
 ### 1. Clone the repo
  
      git clone https://github.com/Ingage-Meetup/Meeting-20200916.git
      
 ### 2. Checkout kens-defactored-code
 
      git checkout kens-defactored-code
      
 ### 3. Open the solution in Visual Studio and compile it
 
      NOTE: You will need .Net core version 3.x to run the solution.
      
 ### 4. Run the tests
 
 ### 5. Run the console app
 
     The console app presents a menu where you can run the following items:
     
     1. Generate Lots Of Hands And Gather Stats
     2. Play a game of poker with two players - console input
     3. Play a game of poker with two players - computer generated
     4. Exit the app
     
     I recommend you try options 1 and 3 prior to refactoring the app.
     
 ### 6. Refactor the PokerHand class
